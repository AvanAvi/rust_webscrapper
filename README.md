# Project in the Works 🚧

Hey there! 👋 Glad you dropped by.

I'm currently elbow-deep in code, embracing the adventurous path of **Trunk Based Development** 🌳 for this project. As such, my README is, let's say, evolving alongside. 

The mission? To craft something not just functional but also a breeze to navigate and use. I'm piecing together knowledge, code, and probably a bit too much coffee (**unwanted personal update : I've quit drinking**), aiming to create something genuinely useful.

### Why the Suspense? 🕵️

Well, I believe in first impressions. The README you're eagerly awaiting will be more than mere words on a screen—it'll be your gateway to understanding the heart and soul of this project. As I'm navigating through the uncharted territories of Trunk Based Development, I want to ensure that what I pen down here is not just informative but invaluable.

In the meantime, here's a slice of Rust humor to brighten your day:

> Why do I, Rust 🦀 programmer, lean towards trunk based development? 
>
> Because life's too short for long branches, and I like my code like I like my coffee: ownership clear and without any unnecessary strings attached! 😄☕🌳

Your patience and curiosity mean the world to me. Feel free to poke around the code and see what's brewing.

Until the grand README unveiling, keep your semicolons close, but your syntax closer. 🦀💻
